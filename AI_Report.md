## MCM 2026 Problem A: Modeling Smartphone Battery Drain

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools during the development of our solution to MCM 2026 Problem A, in accordance with COMAP's contest rules. We used AI as a supplementary tool to assist with coding implementation and text refinement. The core intellectual work—including problem analysis, model conceptualization, mathematical derivation, and result interpretation—was performed entirely by our team.

## 2. AI Usage Description

### 2.1 Code Implementation Assistance

AI tools were used to assist with programming tasks:

- **Syntax help**: Queried correct usage of scipy.integrate.solve_ivp function
- **Code completion**: Used Copilot for auto-completing repetitive code patterns
- **Debugging**: Asked ChatGPT to help identify syntax errors

**Example interaction**:
- Query: "How to implement event detection in scipy ODE solver?"
- Use: Adapted the syntax template to our specific battery discharge model

### 2.2 Writing Assistance

- **Grammar check**: Used AI to proofread English text for grammatical errors
- **Formatting**: Asked for help with LaTeX equation formatting

### 2.3 What AI Was NOT Used For

The following were completed entirely by our team without AI assistance:

- Problem analysis and understanding
- Mathematical model conceptualization and design
- Derivation of all model equations
- Selection of modeling approach and assumptions
- Data analysis methodology and interpretation
- Sensitivity analysis design
- Drawing conclusions and recommendations
- Creating figures and visualizations (content/design)
