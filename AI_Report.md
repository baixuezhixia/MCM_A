## 2. AI Assistance Details

### 2.1 Scope of AI Usage

AI tools were used **only** for code implementation assistance:

| Task Category | AI Tool | Specific Use | Human Oversight |
|---------------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Code Syntax** | GitHub Copilot | Auto-completion for Python scipy functions | All code reviewed and tested by team |
| **Code Debugging** | ChatGPT | Debugging syntax errors in ODE solver | All suggestions verified before use |

### 2.2 Specific AI Interactions

**Query Type**: Implementation syntax for ODE solving
- **Example**: "How to use scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with event detection?"
- **AI Response**: Provided syntax template for RK45 integration
- **Team Action**: Adapted syntax to our specific model, tested extensively, verified numerical accuracy

**Query Type**: Data visualization syntax
- **Example**: "How to create subplots with shared axes in matplotlib?"
- **AI Response**: Provided code snippet for figure layout
- **Team Action**: Modified for our specific visualization needs

### 2.3 Content NOT Generated by AI

The following components were developed **entirely by our team** without AI assistance:

- Mathematical model equations and derivations
- Data analysis methodology and interpretation
- All paper writing (text content, structure, arguments)
- Parameter estimation from datasets
- Physical assumptions and their justifications
- Sensitivity analysis design and conclusions
- Practical recommendations
- Figures and visualizations (content and design)
